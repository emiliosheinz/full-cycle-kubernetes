# Full Cycle K8s

This repository contains the code generated during the Kubernetes module of the Full Cycle course. It contains a simple Go application that prints a message when accessed, and a Dockerfile to build the image which will be used by Kubernetes. Also, inside the `k8s/deployment.yaml` file there is the configuration for the deployment of the application, with examples of how to configure the number of replicas, the config maps, and the liveness and readiness probes.

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes follows the the below hierarchical organization of resources:

_Deployments > Replicasets > Pods > Containers_

## ðŸ”§ Running locally

1. You need to have Kind, Docker, and Kubernetes setup locally
2. Run the following command to initialize the cluster:
    ```bash
    kind create cluster --config k8s/kind.yaml
    ```
2. Run the following command to start the application:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
    ```
3. Run the following command to create the service:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
    ```
4. Run the following command to expose the service (this is necessary because we are running locally and not in a cloud provider):

    ```bash
    kubectl port-forward service/goserver-service 8000:80
    ```

### ðŸŽ¯ Expected result

After running the commands above Kubernetes will create the *deployment*, *replicaset* and *3 pods* for the application. To check if the application is running execute the command below:

```
kubectl get pods
```

It should result in something like this:

```
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
goserver-747c9b6985-jrwf8   1/1     Running   0          19s
goserver-747c9b6985-nwsbn   1/1     Running   0          19s
goserver-747c9b6985-v5bp6   1/1     Running   0          19s
```

Also, when accessing `http://localhost:8080` you should see the message `Hello Full Cycle!!!` printed on the screen.
